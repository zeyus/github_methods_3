# Exercises and objectives

1) Estimate bias and variance based on a true underlying function  
2) Fitting training data and applying it to test sets with and without regularization  

For each question and sub-question, please indicate one of the three following answers:  
    i. I understood what was required of me  
    ii. I understood what was required of me, but I did not know how to fulfil the requirement  
    iii. I did not understand what was required of me  

# EXERCISE 1 - Estimate bias and variance based on a true underlying function  

We can express regression as $y = f(x) + \epsilon$ with $E[\epsilon] = 0$ and $var(\epsilon) = \sigma^2$ ($E$ means expected value)  
  
For a given point: $x_0$, we can decompose the expected prediction error , $E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2]$ into three parts - __bias__, __variance__ and __irreducible error__ (the first two together are the __reducible error__):

The expected prediction error is, which we also call the __Mean Squared Error__:  
$E[(y_0 - \hat{f}(x_0))^2] =  bias(\hat{f}(x_0))^2 + var(\hat{f}(x_0)) + \sigma^2$
  
where __bias__ is;
  
$bias(\hat{f}(x_0)) = E[\hat{f}(x_0)] - f(x_0)$

1) Create a function, $f(x)$ that squares its input. This is our __true__ function  
    i. generate data, $y$, based on an input range of [0, 6] with a spacing of 0.1. Call this $x$
    ii. add normally distributed noise to $y$ with $\sigma=5$ (set a seed to 7 `np.random.seed(7)`) to $y$ and call it $y_{noisy}$
    iii. plot the true function and the generated points  
2) Fit a linear regression using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model` based on $y_{noisy}$ and $x$ (see code chunk below associated with Exercise 1.2)  
    i. plot the fitted line (see the `.intercept_` and `.coef_` attributes of the `regressor` object) on top of the plot (from 1.1.iii)
    ii. now run the code chunk below associated with Exercise 1.2.ii - what does X_quadratic amount to?
    iii. do a quadratic and a fifth order fit as well and plot them (on top of the plot from 1.2.i)
3) Simulate 100 samples, each with sample size `len(x)` with $\sigma=5$ normally distributed noise added on top of the true function    
    i. do linear, quadratic and fifth-order fits for each of the 100 samples  
    ii. create a __new__ figure, `plt.figure`, and plot the linear and the quadratic fits (colour them appropriately); highlight the true value for $x_0=3$. From the graphics alone, judge which fit has the highest bias and which has the highest variance for $x_0$  
    iii. create a __new__ figure, `plt.figure`, and plot the quadratic and the fifth-order fits (colour them appropriately); highlight the true value for $x_0=3$. From the graphics alone, judge which fit has the highest bias and which has the highest variance for $x_0$  
    iv. estimate the __bias__ and __variance__ at $x_0$ for the linear, the quadratic and the fifth-order fits (the expected value $E[\hat{f}(x_0)] - f(x_0)$ is found by taking the mean of all the simulated, $\hat{f}(x_0)$, differences)  
    v. show how the __squared bias__ and the __variance__ is related to the complexity of the fitted models  
    vi. simulate __epsilon__: `epsilon = np.random.normal(scale=5, size=100)`. Based on your simulated values of __bias, variance and epsilon__, what is the __Mean Squared Error__ for each of the three fits? Which fit is better according to this measure? 

    
```{python, eval=TRUE}
# Exercise 1.2
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def square(x):
    return x**2

# generate data, y, based on an input range of [0, 6] with a spacing of 0.1
x = np.arange(0, 6, 0.1)

#  add normally distributed noise to y with sigma=5 (set a seed to 7 `np.random.seed(7)`) to y and call it y_noisy
np.random.seed(7)
y_noisy = x + np.random.normal(0, 5, len(x))

# plot the true function and the generated points

plt.plot(square(x), y_noisy, label='True function')

regressor = LinearRegression()
fit = regressor.fit(x.reshape(-1, 1), y_noisy)
print(fit.score(x.reshape(-1, 1), y_noisy))

```    

```{python, eval=TRUE}
# Exercise 1.2.ii
quadratic = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_quadratic = quadratic.fit_transform(x.reshape(-1, 1))
regressor_quadratic = LinearRegression()
fit_quadratic = regressor_quadratic.fit(X_quadratic, y_noisy)
print(fit_quadratic.score(X_quadratic, y_noisy))
y_quadratic_hat = fit_quadratic.predict(X_quadratic)

```

# EXERCISE 2: Fitting training data and applying it to test sets with and without regularization

Raschka, S., 2015. Python Machine Learning. Packt Publishing Ltd.  

1) Import the housing dataset using the upper chunk of code from p. 280 
    i. and define the correlation matrix `cm` as done on p. 284  
    ii. based on this matrix, do you expect collinearity can be an issue if we run multiple linear regression  by fitting MEDV on LSTAT, INDUS, NOX and RM?  
2) Fit MEDV on  LSTAT, INDUS, NOX and RM (standardize all five variables by using `StandardScaler.fit_transform`, (`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`) by doing multiple linear regression using `LinearRegressionGD` as defined on pp. 285-286
    i. how much does the solution improve in terms of the cost function if you go through 40 iterations instead of the default of 20 iterations?  
    ii. how does the residual sum of squares based on the analytic solution (Ordinary Least Squares) compare to the cost after 40 iterations?
    iii. Bonus question: how many iterations do you need before the Ordinary Least Squares and the Gradient Descent solutions result in numerically identical residual sums of squares?  
3) Build your own cross-validator function. This function should randomly split the data into $k$ equally sized folds (see figure p. 176) (see the code chunk associated with exercise 2.3). It should also return the Mean Squared Error for each of the folds
    i. Cross-validate the fits of your model from Exercise 2.2. Run 11 folds and run 500 iterations for each fit  
    ii. What is the mean of the mean squared errors over all 11 folds?  
4) Now, we will do a Ridge Regression. Use `Ridge` (see code chunk associated with Exercise 2.4) to find the optimal `alpha` parameter ($\lambda$)
    i. Find the _MSE_ (the mean of the _MSE's_ associated with each fold) associated with a reasonable range of `alpha` values (you need to find the lambda that results in the minimum _MSE_)  
    ii. Plot the _MSE_ as a function of `alpha` ($\lambda$). Make sure to include an _MSE_ for `alpha=0` as well  
    iii. Find the _MSE_ for the optimal `alpha`, compare its _MSE_ to that of the OLS regression
    iv. Do the same steps for Lasso Regression `Lasso`  (2.4.i.-2.4.iii.)
    v. Describe the differences between these three models, (the optimal Lasso, the optimal Ridge and the OLS)


```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Exercise 2.3
def cross_validate(estimator, X, y, k): # estimator is the object created by initialising LinearRegressionGD
    mses = list() # we want to return k mean squared errors
    fold_size = y.shape[0] // k # we do integer division to get a whole number of samples
    for fold in range(k): # loop through each of the folds
        
        X_train = ?
        y_train = ?
        X_test = ?
        y_test = ?
        
        # fit training data
        # predict on test data
        # calculate MSE
        
    return mses
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Exercise 2.4
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso
RR = Ridge(alpha=?)
LassoR = Lasso(alpha)
